# Implementation Log: Task 9.2

**Summary:** Captured the third sandbox attempt for executing UAT, including cloned Flutter tooling, failed flutter test/build runs, and updated all UAT documentation + tasks to guide the on-device handoff.

## CLI Evidence
- `flutter test --no-pub test/integration/calibration_flow_test.dart` → Fails instantly because the sandbox blocks creation of the Dart VM server socket (`OS Error: Operation not permitted, errno = 1`).
- `flutter build apk --debug --no-pub` → Gradle wrapper download aborts with `java.net.SocketException: Operation not permitted`, so no APK can be generated.
- `adb devices` → Daemon fails to start (`failed to initialize libusb`, `could not install *smartsocket* listener: Operation not permitted`).

## Notes
- Updated the execution tables + scenario tracker inside `UAT_TEST_SCENARIOS.md` so QA can record evidence quickly once they have hardware access.
- Mirrored the new blockers in `UAT_SIGN_OFF_REPORT.md` and appended the latest status entry inside `tasks.md`.
