# Task 9.2 – Execute UAT Scenarios on Connected Devices

**Date**: 2025-11-17T00:01:19Z
**Engineer**: Codex QA (CLI session)

## Goal
Run the full UAT scenario suite on at least one connected Android device and document the results in `UAT_TEST_SCENARIOS.md`.

## Actions & Evidence
1. Attempted to build the debug APK via `flutter build apk --debug` (repo root). The command failed immediately:
   ```
   /home/rmondo/flutter/bin/internal/update_engine_version.sh: line 74: /home/rmondo/flutter/bin/cache/engine.stamp: Permission denied
   ```
   The sandbox user cannot modify the Flutter SDK cache, so the build artifacts (`app-debug.apk`) were not produced.
2. Attempted to enumerate connected devices via `adb devices`. The daemon startup failed before listing hardware:
   ```
   failed to initialize libusb: LIBUSB_ERROR_OTHER
   could not install *smartsocket* listener: Operation not permitted
   adb: failed to check server version: cannot connect to daemon
   ```
   Without a running daemon the CLI cannot talk to the Pixel 9a that should be attached over USB.
3. Because neither prerequisite (build artifacts nor Android Debug Bridge) could be satisfied inside the Codex sandbox, no UAT scenarios were executed. Documented the blocker details inside `UAT_TEST_SCENARIOS.md` and `UAT_SIGN_OFF_REPORT.md` for downstream QA.

## Outcome
- ✅ Documented CLI limitations and command output so physical QA can reproduce locally.
- ⚠️ UAT execution remains **blocked** pending a workstation with write access to the Flutter SDK cache and USB permissions for `adb`.

## Next Steps
1. Run `flutter build apk --debug` on a local dev machine (outside the Codex sandbox) where Flutter SDK updates are permitted.
2. Connect a physical Android handset, ensure `adb devices` lists it, and capture the device metadata in the execution table.
3. Follow each scenario in `UAT_TEST_SCENARIOS.md`, record Pass/Fail decisions, performance benchmarks, and attach evidence for any issues.
