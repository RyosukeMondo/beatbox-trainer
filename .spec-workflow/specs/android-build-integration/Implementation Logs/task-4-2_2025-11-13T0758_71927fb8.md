### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** GitHub Actions workflow orchestrates the complete Android build pipeline including Flutter setup, Rust toolchain installation, cargo-ndk cross-compilation, and APK packaging verification
- **Frontend Component:** GitHub Actions Runner
- **Backend Endpoint:** Flutter build apk command with Gradle buildRustAndroid task
- **Data Flow:** Push/PR trigger → Setup environment (Java, Android SDK, NDK, Flutter, Rust) → Install cargo-ndk → Flutter build apk → Gradle invokes buildRustAndroid → cargo-ndk compiles for 3 architectures → APK packaging → Verification of .so files in APK → Upload artifacts
