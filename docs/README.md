# Documentation Index

All documentation now lives under `docs/` with mutually-exclusive, collectively
exhaustive categories:

- **architecture/** – system blueprints, dependency information, bridge
  contracts, and supporting research.
- **guides/** – day-to-day playbooks organized by domain:
  - `platform/` – environment setup (Android build + emulator)
  - `qa/` – testing & UAT execution guides
  - `release/` – release and QA checklists
- **reports/** – point-in-time analyses:
  - `engineering/` – metrics, quality, error-handling, performance validation
  - `testing/` – integration & UAT execution reports
  - `release/` – readiness summaries and release build artifacts
- **media/** – supporting images/screenshots referenced from docs.

When adding new documents, pick the category that best fits the document’s
intent so each topic has a single, discoverable home.
